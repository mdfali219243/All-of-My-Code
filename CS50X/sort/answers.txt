sort1                                   

How do you know?:

reversed50,000.txt -> 5.756s
sorted50,000.txt -> 0.644s

For sorted files, sort1 was the fastest in sorting them.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?:


reversed50,000.txt -> 0.459s

For a reversed txt file of 50,000 numbers, it was exponentially faster compared to the other sorting programes.



---
sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?:

reversed50,000.txt -> 4.021s
sorted50,000.txt -> 3.574s

It was the slow sorting program in both a reversed number text file, as well as a sorted text file. as result, we can conclude that this is selection sort.
